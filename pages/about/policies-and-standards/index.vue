    // the page has been mounted and is viewable. Therefore we display the redirecting text before redirecting. This issue has been filed many times with Vue:
    // https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/770, https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/1280, https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/1082

        window.location.href = "https://docs.sparc.science/docs/terms-of-service";
    }
